abstract: This study investigates whether relative performance evaluations of
  labor output are biased in the presence of sentiment, even when the
  (supposedly independent) evaluators are external. Data from a field-experiment
  setting—involving a pro-sport League's best-player award—allows for empirical
  testing of this proposition. After controlling for within-match performance,
  the results show that the match officials provide significantly better
  evaluations to players celebrating a ‘milestone’ game—an occasion on which
  sentimental favorites exist. However, this sentiment bias holds only in
  certain cases, and appears to have weakened in more recent years.
