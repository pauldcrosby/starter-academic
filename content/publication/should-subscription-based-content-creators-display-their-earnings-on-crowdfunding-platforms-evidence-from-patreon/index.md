abstract: In January 2017, the subscription-based crowdfunding platform Patreon
  allowed their users (creators) the ability to hide their earnings from
  existing and potential subscribers. Prior to this, all monthly earnings were
  visible. We investigate what effect this policy change had on creatorsâ€™
  subscriber numbers over the following six months. Using double-robust and
  endogenous treatment estimation techniques, we find evidence that creators who
  removed the visibility of their earnings had more subscribers as a result.
  This suggests that the provision of social information does not lead to an
  increase in subscribers.
