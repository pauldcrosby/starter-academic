abstract: "We use a discrete choice experiment to quantify whether
  superannuation fund members would be willing to accept lower returns for
  higher allocations of renewable energy in their portfolios. Mixed logit
  modelling provides evidence that this willingness is driven by a fund member's
  environmental sentiment. Latent class modelling suggests that two classes of
  superannuation fund members exist: those whose preferences align with a
  renewable energy transition and those who are focused on financial returns.
  Our results suggest that the understanding of \ffiduciary duties, to act in
  the best interests of members, should be broader than a singular focus on
  \ffinancial returns."
