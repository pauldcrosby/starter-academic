abstract: This study investigates potential disruption from advertising-based
  video-on-demand (AVOD) streaming for new-release in-home films. Using
  stated-preference discrete choice experiments on representative samples from
  four major countries, we model demand and examine substitution patterns
  between AVOD and the incumbent transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) model. In
  addition, we consider illegal streaming alternatives, including the
  possibility of using a VPN to provide anonymity of the unlawful activity. We
  find strong preferences for AVOD across each country sample, with large
  cross-price substitution patterns away from TVOD. An entry simulation exercise
  provides back-of-the-envelope estimates for ad pricing required to offset
  reduced revenues if AVOD were offered alongside TVOD for new-release in-home
  films.
