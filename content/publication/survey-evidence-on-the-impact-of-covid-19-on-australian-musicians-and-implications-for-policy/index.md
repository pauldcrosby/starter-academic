abstract: "This study provides survey evidence concerning how COVID-19 has
  impacted Australian musicians.  Between June and July 2020, we surveyed 203
  musicians about the effects of the pandemic on their employment and
  income.  Using a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model, we investigate
  sentiment concerning future employment and income opportunities.  We find
  evidence that this sentiment correlates most strongly with general sentiment
  about industry demand returning post COVID-19.  We find no evidence that
  short-term income support makes a difference to sentiment about future
  opportunities.  Similarly, we find no evidence that pivoting towards online
  media strategies has improved such sentiment.  In addition to recent
  supply-side policies, our results suggest demand-side policies can play an
  important role in the medium to long term by ensuring musicians do not leave
  the industry. "
