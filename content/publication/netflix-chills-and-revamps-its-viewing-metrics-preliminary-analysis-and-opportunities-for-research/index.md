abstract: In November 2021, Netflix surprised industry observers by announcing
  the release of three data sets containing information on its viewing metrics.
  Up until this time, Netflix had been notoriously protective of its data, much
  to the frustration of industry stakeholders and researchers alike. The new
  Netflix data marks a significant development for researchers previously
  hindered by an almost total absence of information concerning product-level
  consumer activity in this space. Supplemented with additional information
  about the wider Netflix catalogue, many potential new research questions can
  now be examined. This study presents and discusses such opportunities. To
  provide context, we also present preliminary descriptive evidence on each of
  the three data sets. While the data currently available are limited in certain
  respects, we believe in time these limitations will decline providing much
  scope for future research.
