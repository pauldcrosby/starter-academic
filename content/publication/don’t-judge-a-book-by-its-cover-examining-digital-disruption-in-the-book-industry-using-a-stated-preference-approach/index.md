abstract: This paper uses a market segmentation approach to examine the effects
  of digital disruption in the book industry. A Bayesian efficient experimental
  design is employed in order to develop a stated preference discrete choice
  experiment that incorporates an array of book formats and attributes. The
  experiment was conducted on a panel of Australian readers. The results were
  analysed using a latent class model, leading to the identification of three
  distinct classes of book readers. The largest class of readers is comprised of
  ‘technological adopters’ who demonstrate a similar willingness to read on both
  traditional printed book formats and newer digital ones. Members of this class
  rely on critical review scores to make purchasing decisions and are the
  youngest of the three classes. Second is a class of ‘popular readers.’ This
  group consists of price-sensitive readers who clearly favour reading popular
  fiction on traditional paper-based book formats only. The third group are
  ‘avid readers’ who exhibit the highest willingness to pay for books and show a
  desire to read books of all genres. The identification of discrete segments of
  readers, along with their associated price elasticities and willingness to pay
  figures, can assist book industry stakeholders (such as book publishers and
  sellers) with the development of effective strategies to guide them through
  the various stages of digital book formats technology adoption life cycle.
  Such results can also be used to help steer cultural policy makers during a
  period of rapid technological change and uncertainty.
