abstract: Backward compatibility is a governance strategy that can be adopted by
  platform owners to build indirect network effects and encourage owners of
  older compatible software to update to newer hardware models. Previous
  research shows backward compatibility has a positive effect on hardware sales.
  However, there is limited evidence concerning the other associated costs and
  benefits. In particular, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of backward
  compatibility on software sales despite its importance in understanding the
  full range of possible network and sales displacement effects associated with
  the strategy. Using weekly software-level sales data from the U.S. video
  gaming industry, we find that backward-compatible hardware associates with
  increased sales of software released for the previous hardware generation.
  However, we find that the introduction of backward compatibility may not
  increase the sales of new hardware if the feature is not available immediately
  at launch. Further, we show that the increased sales of software for the old
  hardware platform may cannibalize software sales for the new platform.
  Overall, our results suggest that backward compatibility is time-sensitive and
  involves several important trade-offs. We, therefore, conclude that the use of
  backward compatibility needs to be carefully considered by platform owners
  prior to implementation.
