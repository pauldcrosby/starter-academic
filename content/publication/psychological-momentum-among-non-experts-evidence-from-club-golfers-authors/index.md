abstract: This study examines the link between psychological momentum and
  performance. In sporting settings, the notion that prior performance may
  influence future outcomes is a familiar one to fans and athletes alike.
  However, the identification of a causal relationship between psychological
  momentum and subsequent performance is complicated by the need to control for
  the ability of a player and the situational context. Furthermore, studies
  focused on professional athletes may understate results due to the
  well-practiced nature of such individuals. To address these challenges, we
  develop a novel method of isolating the effects of a change in psychological
  momentum. Using data from club golf competitions, we find evidence of a
  cold-hand effect among both male and female players. We also find evidence of
  a hot-hand effect among male players only. Investigations into the individual
  playing characteristics that drive psychological momentum reveal that male
  players who can keep a cool head during periods of success and failure perform
  better. Conversely, males who are prone to cold-hand effects perform worse.
  Our results can be placed in context with the existing literature, which
  primarily examines professional athletes.
