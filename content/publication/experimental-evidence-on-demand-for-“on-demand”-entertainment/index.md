abstract: This study applies stated-preference choice experiments and
  accompanying surveys to examine how Subscription Video on Demand (SVoD) has
  disrupted film and television consumption. We examine demand for a large set
  of traditional consumption alternatives, such as cinema and free-to-air TV, as
  well as newer internet-based subscription services, such as Netflix. We
  consider a range of alternative-specific product attributes —including price,
  viewing quality, and release delay— that allow us to quantify substitution
  effects and willingness-to-pay estimates. In addition, we also consider
  illegal viewing alternatives, with associated attributes related to
  (potential) punishment that inform on the efficacy of policy against digital
  piracy. Our primary results reveal that while some traditional alternatives
  remain important, consumers derive significant utility from SVoD, which
  provides a large surplus at current pricing. We also observe that marginal
  effects and willingness-to-pay estimates are sensitive to ex-ante interest in
  a film or TV series. Moreover, we provide evidence that consumers can be
  segmented in relation to (survey-reported) piracy experience, as well as
  perceptions of punishment risk and (industry) damage associated with piracy.
  We also find some evidence that increasing punishment probability and fines
  may discourage illegal consumption. Finally, we provide some validation of our
  results with a follow-up survey conducted six months after the experiment.
