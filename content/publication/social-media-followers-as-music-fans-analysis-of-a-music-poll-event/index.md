abstract: This study examines how success in an online music poll affects
  artists’ social media followers. On average, being voted into this poll
  increases artists’ followers by approximately double that of the control
  group. Furthermore, this increase is positively related to poll rank and
  less-established artists benefit relatively more from this success.
