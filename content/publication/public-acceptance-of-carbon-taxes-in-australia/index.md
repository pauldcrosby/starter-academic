abstract: "Carbon taxes can be a low-cost approach to reducing carbon dioxide
  emissions but are often constrained by public acceptability. Our study
  investigates public support for carbon taxes in Australia in two ways. First,
  we use a discrete choice experiment to quantify willingness to pay for carbon
  tax design features through higher electricity

  bills. Our results show higher utility for schemes that provide \ffinancial
  support to low-income households and that recycle revenues for low-carbon
  technologies. Survey respondents exhibit a preference against too much
  information and against revenues being recycled for policies to change
  individual behaviour. An appropriate manager of the carbon tax could be a
  federal government department. Second, we also examine whether there are
  differences in preferences for the terms `carbon tax' and `carbon price': in
  this context, the term `carbon tax' does not majorly affect public
  acceptability. Our detailed carbon pricing scheme design and methodology can
  be tailored for studies of public acceptability of carbon taxes in other
  countries, potentially contributing to global emissions reductions."
