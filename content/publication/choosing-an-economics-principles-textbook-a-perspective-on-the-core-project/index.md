abstract: This article discusses recent changes in the teaching of economics
  principles at universities, focused on the CORE project’s textbook, The
  Economy, which was developed in response to the Global Financial Crisis. The
  textbook aims to transform economics education to focus more on market
  disequilibria and power relationships than is typically the case in other
  first-year textbooks, and to cover in more detail issues of most interest to
  students such as climate change, inequality and the future of work. The
  article presents three key criteria for assessing a first-year undergraduate
  economics textbook and evaluates the CORE textbook against those criteria.
  This evaluation is also based on our experience teaching economics using CORE
  to a large and diverse cohort of students. We suggest that while CORE’s
  strength lies in the historical narrative approach and the relevance of its
  topics that can appeal to students’ interests, using the textbook to teach to
  large cohorts of students, especially students for whom this is their only
  exposure to economics, can be challenging. Despite these challenges, the CORE
  project has already fundamentally achieved its main goal of changing the way
  economics is taught. In recent years, other introductory economics textbooks
  have followed CORE’s lead, incorporating more real-world examples and
  discussion to illustrate economic concepts and theories.
