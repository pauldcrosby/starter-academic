abstract: This study draws upon psychological models of momentum to test for the
  existence of characteristics such as the hot hand and whether such
  characteristics predict better or worse overall performance. Using data from
  professional golf tournaments, we show that the negative emotions associated
  with poor performance (such as a loss of confidence) have a greater influence
  in the short run on scoring than positive emotions associated with prior
  success. We find that male and female golfers respond similarly to prior hole
  performance, while better players may be more prone to dips in performance
  after recent failures than other players. Overall, our results provide
  empirical support for the notion that performance training should incorporate
  psychological skills, including strategies for controlling emotional responses
  to success and failure in the short run.
