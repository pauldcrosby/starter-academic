abstract: In the world of professional sports, a manager's ability to influence
  team success is often questioned. This study exploits a unique feature of
  Major League Baseball (MLB), which has different rules of play depending on
  what league a team is in, to examine whether managerial impact is driven by
  the level of responsibility they are given over in-game decision making. Using
  47 seasons of MLB data, we find evidence that the development of human capital
  in the form of on-the-job experience and exposure to prior success is only
  beneficial when managers are employed in more complex decision-making
  environments. The results of this study have ramifications on the hiring
  decisions, both in terms of personnel choice and remuneration, of professional
  sports organisations.
